# Todo App with Flask
- This code is about a Todo app built with the Flask framework
- Based on this tutorial [Youtube link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1RJmh_OqeA) 
- My small modification:
  - Use POST request for deleting tasks (for security enhancement)
 
# Run
- Install packages in `requirements.txt` with `pip` or `conda`
- Run `python app.py`
